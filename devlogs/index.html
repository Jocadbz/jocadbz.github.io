<br>
<p>Hello everyone, i have some cool news to share. Today marks an new sub-release<br>
for shellpkg.<br>
<br>
The local package installation function has been added. This is an thing i "imported" from<br>
the legacy shellpkg, which means that if you build an personal package, you can install it<br>
without having to upload on the repos. Be aware of the syntax, that is kinda different to avoid complications<br>
betwwen functions.<br>
That's it for today, enjoy.</p>
