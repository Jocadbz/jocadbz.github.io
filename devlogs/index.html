<h1 align="center">Shellpkg Devlog - 01/22</h1>
<p>By Jocadbz</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Welcome to the first Shellpkg Devlog of the history.<br>
I decided to start this because it's an cool and painless way<br>
to resume the new features and help people to see what's going on<br>
with the project. Since i don't really have anything to write, here are<br>
some information about how these Devlogs will be published.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>It's in my plans to write (at least) monthly, and when an new release pops up.<br>
It will NOT be possible to read any older devlogs because it would be hard to fit<br>
in my storage repo (kek).Be aware that these logs will be purely technical,<br>
and the plans of new features, bug fixes and improvements can change with time.<br>
I Really hope that you guys enjoy these new improvements. Heading out.</p>
