<h3 align="center">New functions,new release and PKGfest</h3>
<br>
<p>Hello everyone, i have some cool news to share. After an little time off<br>
to take care of personal interests (I hate job applications now, btw) i'm back to developing.<br>
In one day i made an really cool progress, so let's start talking.</p>
<h3 align="center">New function, and an new release</h3>
<p>I had this idea an while back then. It consists of adding an txt file to the repos,<br>
so everytime the "info" function is called, the system downloads the txt file, prints it<br>
on the screen, and deletes the file. Pretty simple, but acctually darn cool. And plus, i'm giving<br>
the mantainers more work to do. ;)<br>
So, i'm gonna finish up wrapping up things and i expect to release the new "1.1.0" version in an few hours<br>
after this post goes up on the site.</p>
<br>
<h3 align="center">PKGfest has started</h3>
<p>You see, my package manager is cool but it only has two packages... That is why i'm launching this "event"<br>
so anyone interested can reach out the wiki and create packages. The people who created all the packages during the<br>
PKGfest will have their name forever listed on the README.md file of the repo. So if you are interested, just check<br>
on the github page of shellpkg.
<br>
<p>That's it for today folks, see you next time.</p>
