<br>
<p>Hello everyone, i have some cool news to share.<br>
<br>
I thinked an little about what i want from shellpkg. I want something that works<br>
is reliable, and easy to use. The actual code works, but it's quite far from what i want.<br>
So, i will be doing something that looks like Winget. Every package will be an Manifest, with hashes,<br>
and an way easier packaging. I really hope this helps in the future of shellpkg.<br>
<br>
Because of that, i will shut down the repo we have on github (and change it for an new one), and<br>
freeze the development of the actual shellpkg.<br>
That's it for today, enjoy.</p>
