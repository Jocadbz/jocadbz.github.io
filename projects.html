<h2 align="center">My Projects</h2>
<p>Projects i do just for... fun.</p>
<h3 align="center">Solpkg</h3>
<p>I think this was one of the first projects I was actually proud of.<br>
I got the idea from an already existing wrapper for pacman, but since I was using<br>
Solus, there was nothing that already existed for EOPKG. So I made exactly that,<br>
solely for the "I need this". I can also say that half of my Python knowledge<br>
came from reading the sys.argv documentation and trying to apply that on the code.<br>
Even tought i'm on Arch now, I'm still mantaining the project, and I'm planning<br>
some changes to the functioning of the code (I'm just lazy to do that, lol.).<br>

<h2>Pacy</h2>
<p>The second project I developed. After getting used to Solpkg, I came to Arch<br>
And found that the ability to just type "solpkg i package" was gone forever.<br>
So I spended time to develop a "copy" of Solpkg, and Pacy was born. The idea<br>
of the name came from pac (pacman) + y (py), it's pretty smart, isn't it?<br>
Pacy is still actively developed, and the version 4 was just released. Also,<br>
this project was one of my first sucessful experiences with Arch packaging.<br>

<h3 align="center">Classh</h3>
<p>That was (still is, actually) a very tricky experience with my knowledge.<br>
The goal was to create a Shell similar to Bash and Zsh with Python. Coding it<br>
wasn't hard, it was boring. It's fairly easy to implement most of things I wished<br>
but my mind couldn't figure out a simple way to do that. The history feature is a<br>
example of that. It was done in the most shitty way because i didn't wanted to get<br>
too deep on the rest. And thinking about the other shells that exist, i wouldn't<br>
stop using them in favour of Classh. So, why bother developing a product if you<br>
aren't going to use it? So, you can consider it froze, I don't plan in updating it anymore.<br>

<h3 align="center">Power mode</h3>
<p>With the freedesktop foundation trying to improve the Linux desktop by creating<br>
tools that cover use cases, we got Power Profiles, the best library to manage CPU<br>
profiles. GNOME and Plasma, he two giants of the Linux Desktop adopted them, and<br>
Settings are available on both control centers. If your desktop don't yet have GUI<br>
support, you can use the command-line tool, "powerprofilesctl". And yes, it does<br>
it's job well, but still, some missing features and overral improvements are missing,<br>
but that isn't their focus, since they want every DE adopt it. But since I prefer<br>
using the CLI tool, i've developed powermode, which is basically a wrapper for the<br>
CLI tool. It has "Visual" anwsers to commands, and improved usability. This tool<br>
is mantained, but it reached a state where i don't see any visble improvements I can implement.<br>
