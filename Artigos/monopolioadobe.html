<h2 align="center">Adobe's creative monopoly</h2>
<img class="howcute" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F3-StlfPrByE%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" alt="howcute" <="" img="">
<p>As you know, Adobe has always had a small "part" on the internet. First it was<br>
with Glorious Flash Player. If you've never played a flash game, what world do you<br>
live in? Click games, Friv, 360 games, Good times... Then I believe it was (until today, actually)<br>
with Adobe acrobat DC, which was the best PDF reader at that time. Today, Adobe is<br>
best known for the creative industry, being the creator of Photoshop, Premiere, <br>
Illustrator, etc... And I'm not going to lie, the products aren't bad. All are very<br>
powerful, and somewhat simple. The problems are different.</p>
<h2 align="center">Exorbitant prices</h2>
<p> Adobe has ended the lifetime purchase service, and now, you have to pay about<br>
300 reais PER MONTH to Adobe if you want Creative Cloud. Adobe did this for a reason:<br>
They know their services are the industry standard, and people will pay Adobe whatever<br>
they want for their products. Alternatives exist: GIMP, Da Vinci Resolve, Inkscape,<br>
Kirita, all are quite capable, but the problem is that people who keep paying can't<br>
or don't WANT to learn. And it's not like the commands are 100% different.</p>
<br>
<p>As this monopoly continues, the creative cloud will become more and more inaccessible, and we will run out of alternatives.</p>
