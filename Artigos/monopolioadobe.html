<h2 align="center">Adobe's creative monopoly</h2>
<img class="howcute" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F3-StlfPrByE%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" alt="howcute" <="" img="">
<p>As you know, Adobe has always had a small "part" on the internet. First it was with Glorious Flash Player.<br>
If you've never played a flash game, what world do you live in? Click games, Friv, 360 games, Good times...<br>
Then I believe it was (until today, actually) with Adobe acrobat DC, which was the best PDF reader<br>
at that time.<br>
Today, Adobe is best known for the creative industry, being the creator of Photoshop, Premiere, Illustrator, etc...<br>
And I'm not going to lie, the products aren't bad. All are very powerful, and somewhat simple. The problems are different.</p>
<h2 align="center">Exorbitant prices</h2>
<p> Adobe has ended the lifetime purchase service, and now, you have to pay about 300 reais PER MONTH to Adobe if you want Creative Cloud.<br>
Adobe did this for a reason: They know their services are the industry standard, and people will pay Adobe whatever they want for their products.<br>
Alternatives exist: GIMP, Da Vinci Resolve, Inkscape, Kirita, all are quite capable, but the problem is that people who keep paying can't<br>
or don't WANT to learn. And it's not like the commands are 100% different.</p>
<br>
<p>As this monopoly continues, the creative cloud will become more and more inaccessible, and we will run out of alternatives.</p>
