<p>Hey! You probably noticed at this point, but the whole site is now on english!<br>
<br>
This was done for the following reasons:<br>
- In the comunnity, I only speak english<br>
- English is the best shitpost language<br>
- ratio + lmao + L + didn't asked + get rekt<br>
<br>
I will spend the next week fixing translation errors. Enjoy!</p>
