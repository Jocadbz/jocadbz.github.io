<h1 align="center">Distrohopping sucks</h1>
<img class="howcute" src="https://getsol.us//imgs/release-images/4.3/Budgie.jpg" alt="howcute" <="" img="">
<p>I am angry, sad and very angry. I may have wasted several hours on this thing I call "the addiction" more<br>
mortal that exists: The Hopping Distro</p>
<h2 align="center">What is Distrohopping?</h2>

<p>Distro-Hopping is a term that refers to the activity or hobby of Linux users to switch<br>
frequently between distributions, exploring them and trying out multiple distributions in a <br>
try to find the one that best fits your needs.</p>
<p>I jumped from several to several distros, Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, Pop! OS, Feren OS, among others.<br>
What I wanted was a DE that was nice, light, and easy to use.<br>
The Gnome interface is very nice to use, but it consumes a lot<br>
XFCE consumes almost nothing, about 500mb of ram, ugly as hell, and customization takes hours.<br>
The famous WM, like the i3 and the sway, are very light and don't need to be pretty, but they're not easy<br>
to use.</p>
<p>I was in this beautiful impasse until I remembered that I had a distro that has everything I want:</p>
<h2 align="center">The glorious Solus</h2>
<p>The Budgie interface is one that combines everything I want. It is written in Vala (I think) <br>
so it consumes much less than Gnome (Which is written in Javascript), it is much prettier than XFCE<br>
and it is easy to use even for a Windows user.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally I found the cure for distrohopping. Better focus on my Github now.</p>
