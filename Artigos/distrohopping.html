<h1 align="center">Distrohopping sucks</h1>
<img class="howcute" src="https://getsol.us//imgs/release-images/4.3/Budgie.jpg" alt="howcute" <="" img="">
<p>I am angry, sad and very angry. I may have wasted several hours on this thing
I call "the addiction" most mortal that exists: The Distro Hopping</p>
<h2 align="center">What is Distrohopping?</h2>

<p>Distro-Hopping is a term that refers to the activity or hobby of Linux users<br>
to switch frequently between distributions, exploring them and trying out multiple<br>
distributions in a try to find the one that best fits your needs. I jumped from<br>
several to several distros, Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, Pop! OS, Feren OS, among others.<br>
What I wanted was a DE that was nice, light, and easy to use. The Gnome interface<br>
is very nice to use, but it consumes a lot of resources. XFCE consumes almost nothing,<br>
about 500mb of ram, ugly as hell, and customization takes hours. The famous WM,<br>
like i3 and the sway, are very light and don't need to be pretty, but they're not easy.<br>
<p>I was in this beautiful impasse until I remembered that I had a distro that has everything I want:</p>
<h2 align="center">The glorious Solus</h2>
<p>The Budgie interface is one that combines everything I want. It is written in<br>
Vala (I think) so it consumes much less than Gnome (Which is written in Javascript),<br>
it is much prettier than XFCE and it is easy to use even for a Windows user.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally I found the cure for distrohopping. Better focus on my Github now.</p>
