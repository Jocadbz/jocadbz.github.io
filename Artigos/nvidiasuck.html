<h2 align="center">Nvidia is the worst video card brand in history</h2>
<img class="howcute" src="https://i.redd.it/8i2aesyicyr61.jpg" alt="howcute" <="" img="">
<p>Please do not buy Nvidia graphics cards. They can be powerful, but you'll spend<br>
more time figuring out why it doesn't work than actually playing on it. Let's take<br>
an example. On linux, you have to install the proprietary drivers, which is not <br>
that difficult. But actually it is. For example, I've seen several cases of people<br>
trying to use their video card with proprietary drivers, and after restarting the<br>
computer, it just didn't show any video.</p>
<h2 align="center">What about AMD cards?</h2>
<p>Install the card, turn on the computer and use it. Just that. When we say to <br>
prefer AMD's, and because of the quality of the software. The fact that the drivers<br>
are open-source makes it possible to include their drivers in the repositories of<br>
many distros, such as Debian (which I use).</p>
<h2 align="center"> Is the headache the only problem ?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately not. Nvidia doesn't care about you. For those who play with their<br>
video cards. To them, you're just a walking wallet with legs. They even launched<br>
a CPU for Bitcoin mining, which shows that they only go after what makes the most<br>
money, leaving aside, the people who USE their GPUs. In other words, we have bad<br>
products, bad DRIVERS, and bad customer service.</p>
<br>
<p>If you still want to opt for an Nvidia card, that's fine, go for it. But know that you will not have a good service.</p>
