<p>This is probably the biggest article I've ever written.</p>
<h1 align="center">I will never leave you Firefox</h1>

<p>"Oh, but Firefox is bad"<br>
"Oh, but you should use another browser"<br>
Honestly, Firefox remains the best browser. Fast, easy, secure and open-source.<br>
Recently, Firefox has been losing a lot of users, which made me re-evaluate my choice<br>
So, I've tested every browser I can, and this is a solid review of the ones I've tested.</p>
<h2 align="center">Chromium</h2>

<p>I started with the most famous browser there is. Glorious, the benchmark smasher,<br>
the amazing... normal browser. Honestly, Chromium is really cool, more for being<br>
just a "ghost" compared to its big brother, Chrome, it costs some features like<br>
synchronization. Not having that kind of resource, I honestly gave up on the spot,<br>
but if you don't care about synchronization, chromium is a great browser.</p>
<h2 align="center">Gnome Web</h2>

<p>So, Gnome Web is not available in my distribution's repositories, so I had to<br>
compile it directly from git. And honestly, it's unusable. It barely works on Youtube,<br>
and only performs well on pure HTML sites (like mine). It is quite broken on some<br>
sites, but I see a certain evolution in it little by little. Apart from that they<br>
support Firefox Sync, what a bonus for me. It's definitely cool.</p>
<h2 align="center">Vivaldi</h2>

<p>This was probably one of my best experiences behind Chromium. It is not 100% open-source,<br>
but the fact that some of the parts were open made me kind of...curious. I already<br>
used it at the time of Winblows, so I have an account there and all. AND MY GOD,<br>
it's like the KDE of browsers. Everything about it is extremely customizable.<br>
Only he seemed a little slow to me... for some reason. I had the feeling that the<br>
pages were loading slower, so I kind of lost the animation. It also doesn't support<br>
detecting whether the OS is using dark mode or not, which is kind of annoying.<br>
It was not the best experience, but compared to other browsers it wins the 3rd place.<br>
Definitely take a look at it to see if you like it or not.</p>
<h2 align="center">Brave</h2>

<p>I didn't like Brave. It puts a lot of things in your face, like the personalized<br>
ads you make money watching, and he also seemed slower to me. There are things to<br>
improve, but I don't think I could use it as my main browser.</p>
<h2 align="center">The veredict:</h2>

<p>All the browsers I've tried have a certain glitch that prevents me from using<br>
it, except Firefox. I don't know if it's because I've gotten used to how Firefox<br>
works, or because I've been using it since Windows, but now I can't get out of it.</p>
<br>
<p>Firefox remains the best browser for me. Let's see if that changes someday.</p>
