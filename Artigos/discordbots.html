<h1 align="center">Discord Bots (And Why They're So Useful)</h1>
<img class="howcute" src="https://thefrisky.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Discord-bots-730x411.jpg" alt="howcute"></img>
<p>If you use (or have used) Discord, you've probably come across one of the<br>
Discord Bots. They have various functions, fun commands, etc. Now, why are they so used?</p>
<h2 align="center">It''s usefulness</h2>
<p>From what I've seen, bots are used for their moderation functions. A Server<br>
Administrator can easily ban, mute and kick a user who is causing problems. Discord<br>
doesn't natively offer many options, so using bots is a big plus. The most famous<br>
bots I know are without a doubt Lorrita, Carl, MEE6, among others.</p>
<br>
<h2 align="center">Small Bots also deserve attention</h2>
<p>There are some small bots that, despite not being well known, are very powerful.<br>
An example it's the Threadripper bot, from my friend s0ra. It takes great care of<br>
one of discord's new features, threads. I'm also developing my Bot, but it would<br>
be unfair to talk about it because it's not ready yet.</p>
<h2 align="center">Is it worth using bots?</h2>
<p>I would say yes. Bots that have been around for a long time are quite mature.<br>
It's functions are very powerful, and bring benefits even to the smallest servers.</p>
<br>
<p>That was basically the article.</p>
