<p>I have serious problems getting out of my favorite text editor, Vim. As a reminder<br>
to myself, I am writing this article.</p>
<h2 align="center">Method 1 - Hard Exit</h2>
<p>Firstly, with this method, you lose all your data. It's a small price to pay.<br>
<br>
Step 1 - Remove the HD (or SSD) from your computer <br>
Step 2 - Destroy your HD (or SSD) and buy a new one online.</p>
<br>
<h2 align="center">Method 2 - Rewrite</h2>
<p>For this way you need to be a head of state or president, if not, use methods 1 and 3.<br>
<br>
Step 1 - Find the location of Bram Moolenaar, author of Vim. <br>
Step 2 - Extract information from his Github passwords <br>
Step 3 - Hack the Github central servers, and add a "Logout" button to the original Vim code<br>
Step 4 - Manually recompile Vim from Github and exit Vim with the button</p>
<br>
<h2 align="center">Method 3 - Total Nuke</h2>
<p>For this method, you must have access to Dynamite and Fire. <br>
<br>
Step 1 - Get 10 kilos of gunpowder and put on top of the computer<br>
Step 2 - Stay at a distance of about 10 meters <br>
Step 3 - Blow up the computer <br>
Step 4 - Buy a new one online</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I hope this guide will be useful to you. They were the easiest methods I found.</p>
