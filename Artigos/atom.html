<h1 align="center">You should stop using VS Code and use Atom</h1>
<img class="howcute" src="https://www.vozidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/atom-logo-editor-texto.png" alt="howcute" <="" img="">
<p>I think everyone I know uses Visual Studio Code to program. And he's not bad.<br>
But he has a lot of problems that I can't ignore, so I've been looking for an <br>
alternative. And I think I finally found it.</p>
<h2 align="center">VS Code issues</h2>
<p>It works very well, I have no doubts. But it consumes a lot of PC resources,<br>
which makes it very heavy on the machine.The support for GIT and Github isn't the<br>
best either, and I was often confused if I had already pushed the repository or not,<br>
and resorted to GIT in the terminal to find out. It also has Microsoft Spyware in it,<br>
which can only be removed if you compile straight from the sourceor download VS Codium,<br>
which is essentially the VS Code package compiled without spyware.</p>
<br>
<h2 align="center">What is the Atom better at?</h2>
<p>In fact, Atom was the main code editor on Github, at the time it had not yet<br>
been purchased by microsoft. So they focused a lot on collaborative editing and<br>
Github integration. After Microsoft bought Github, she was already developing VS Code,<br>
so Atom development was left to the community. In terms of resources, it consumes<br>
MUCH less resources than VS Code, even though they are both in Electron. It's integration<br>
with git and Github is very well done, offering a window to manage your changes,<br>
to create commits, and push the repository. It also has a built-in window to support<br>
if your SSH key is encrypted (like mine).</p>
<br>
<h2 align="center">In terms of language support?</h2>
<p>Well, I usually write in Python and HTML, so I can confirm that these two languages<br>
work well. All I had to do was go to the packages tab of the editor and install<br>
the "ide-python" package and boom, total Python support. Apparently it also supports<br>
other languages. I tested it with Rust, for example.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Atom is much prettier than VS Code too. Just talking.</p>
