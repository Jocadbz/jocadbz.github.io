<h1 align="center">You should stop using VS Code and use Atom</h1>

<p>I think everyone I know uses Visual Studio Code to program. And he's not bad.<br>
But he has a lot of problems that I can't ignore, so I've been looking for an alternative. And I think I finally found it.</p>
<h2 align="center">VS Code issues</h2>
<p>It works very well, I have no doubts. But it consumes a lot of PC resources, which makes it very heavy on the machine.<br>
The support for GIT and Github isn't the best either, and I was often confused if I had already pushed the repository or not,<br>
and resorted to GIT in the terminal to find out. It also has Microsoft Spyware in it, which can only be removed if you compile straight from the source<br>
or download VS Codium, which is essentially the VS Code package compiled without spyware.</p>
<br>
<h2 align="center">What is the Atom better at?</h2>
<p>In fact, Atom was the main code editor on Github, at the time it had not yet been purchased<br>
by microsoft. So they focused a lot on collaborative editing and Github integration. After Microsoft<br>
bought Github, she was already developing VS Code, so Atom development was left to the community.<br>
In terms of resources, it consumes MUCH less resources than VS Code, even though they are both in Electron.<br>
Its integration with git and Github is very well done, offering a window to manage your changes, to create commits,<br>
and push the repository. It also has a built-in window to support if your SSH key is encrypted (like mine).</p>
<br>
<h2 align="center">In terms of language support?</h2>
<p>Well, I usually write in Python and HTML, so I can confirm that these two languages work well.<br>
all I had to do was go to the packages tab of the editor and install the "ide-python" package and boom, total<br>
Python support. Apparently it also supports other languages. I tested it with Rust, for example.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Atom is much prettier than VS Code too. Just talking.</p>
