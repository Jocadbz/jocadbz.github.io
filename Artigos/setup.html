<h1 align="center">What do I use to create these stupid websites</h1>
<img class="howcute" src="https://www.gta5.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pc-da-xuxa.jpg" alt="howcute" <="" img="">
<p>This is like one of those videos where people show the PCs that cost 10,000 to<br>
run free fire, so I'll show you my laptop and what I use to create the scripts and this website.</p>
<h2 align="center">The machine</h2>
<p>It's literally a regular laptop: Intel Core i3-6006U, 4GB RAM, 1TB HD, running<br>
LMDE 4 with i3wm. You are right, he's relatively weak, but he's good enough for me,<br>
especially since the programs I use do not require "power" and the i3 is very light.<br>
With Thunderbird, Discord, Schildchat, Discord, Vim and some tabs in Firefox, RAM<br>
consumption does not exceed 2GB.</p>
<br>
<h2 align="center">Software</h2>
<p>I use things that are very, very conventional. I use Vim as a text editor, Firefox<br>
as my main browser. Some extra apps include Discord and Schildchat (Matrix Client)<br>
as my chat apps. And also the glorious Thunderbird as my email client.</p>
<br>
<p>That's pretty much it. I'll update annually so consider this as 2021 edition.</p>
